# Focus Timer – Chrome Extension

## Overview
Focus Timer is a simple Chrome extension I built for myself to support focused study sessions.  
I often found it distracting and inconvenient to use my phone just to run a timer while studying, so I decided to create a lightweight, distraction-free timer directly in the browser.

This project is intentionally minimal and designed for personal productivity rather than as a commercial product.

## Why I Built This
- I needed a dedicated study timer while working on my laptop
- Using my phone for timing was breaking focus and leading to unnecessary distractions
- I wanted something clean, fast, and always accessible in the browser
- This project helped me practice building a complete Chrome extension from scratch
